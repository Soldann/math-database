This is my math database program for storing math proofs and other notes.

NOTE: You must set up a SQL server with a user with sufficient permissions prior to use.

Commands:

insert -> inserts into the database
print all -> prints all proofs in the database
search name -> returns proofs with that name
search tags -> returns all proofs with at least one of the provided tags
exit -> exits the program
